# Contributing to Slime Rancher Planner REBORN
First, thank you very much for your interest in improving this project!

## Issues or feature requests
If you experience a bug or you have a feature request please check [open issues](https://github.com/deathbypain/SlimeRancherPlanner-REBORN/issues) first to see if anything similar has already been reported or suggested. If not, open a new issue of the appropriate type.

## Contributing with code
If you want to add a feature or squash a bug yourself, feel free to add it as an Issue first and make it clear that you intend to personally handle it. If the idea does not fit within the scope of this project, I will try to make that clear before any significant work is done.

* First, please be aware that I (deathbypain) did not write the vast majority of this code; that honor goes to [baatochan](https://github.com/baatochan), so it's thanks to them that this project exists at all. It will be your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the existing codebase before making changes.
* Please create your own fork of the repo and do all your work in your new fork. 
* Commit your work frequently and write meaningful commit comments.
* Make descriptive in-line comments in your code.
* When ready, open a pull request. I will then review and test your code, and either merge it or provide feedback if there are any issues.
* In this repo, the default branch is `master`. When changes have been merged into `master` and validated, they will then be pushed to the `webapp` branch which automatically publishes it to the actual webpage.

### Thanks again for taking your time to contribute!
